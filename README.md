# BERT-LDA-Review-Insights

This project aims to analyze user reviews of ChatGPT using advanced natural language processing techniques. We employ BERT for sentiment analysis to understand user sentiments accurately and use LDA for topic modeling to uncover prevalent themes in the feedback.


To dive into the ChatGPT reviews, we turned to BERT for sentiment analysis because it’s exceptionally good at understanding the nuances in language. Unlike simpler methods that might miss the subtleties of how people express their feelings, BERT can grasp the context and meaning behind user comments more accurately. This means we get a clearer picture of whether users are genuinely happy, neutral, or unhappy with their experience. By using BERT, we can better categorize the sentiments in the reviews, which helps us pinpoint areas where we’re doing well and where we need to improve.

After analyzing sentiments with BERT, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to dig deeper into what users are talking about. LDA helps us uncover the main topics or themes in the reviews, giving us a clearer view of what people are focusing on, whether it’s specific features or common issues. By combining the sentiment scores with the insights from LDA, we can better understand not just how people feel, but also what’s driving those feelings. This approach lets us make more informed decisions and improvements, ensuring we address the right areas to enhance user satisfaction.
